# Words Frequency 

The task is to find the most frequently used words in the file in order, along with their frequency

We are using to store words a trie. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie]

Trie.list is a slice with most frequent words.
During inserting we will update the list.
There is a text.converter ror parsing strings to words.
